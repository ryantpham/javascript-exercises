Function Fibonacci(n)
    If n is less than or equal to 0
        Return 0
    Else if n is equal to 1
        Return 1
    Else
        Initialize a variable 'a' with 0
        Initialize a variable 'b' with 1
        For each number 'i' from 2 to n
            Calculate 'c' as the sum of 'a' and 'b'
            Assign the value of 'b' to 'a'
            Assign the value of 'c' to 'b'
        End the loop
        Return 'b' as the nth Fibonacci number
